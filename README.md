# RNA-velocity
## Difference between pseudotime analysis vs. velocity analysis
*Trajectory vs. Velocity:* Pseudotime analysis provides a static ordering of cells based on their current state, assuming a unidirectional progression, whereas RNA velocity predicts future changes in gene expression, providing a dynamic view of cellular state changes.

*Output Type:* Pseudotime results in a continuous trajectory that cells follow, while RNA velocity provides a vector field, indicating the direction and speed of changes in gene expression.
