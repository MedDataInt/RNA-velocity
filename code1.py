Dear Dr. Mi and Dr. Zhou,

It is with a heavy heart that I am writing to inform you that I will be moving on from Mi Lab to accept an new offer for a Senior Bioinformatic Scientist position at HJF. While the final offer is still pending due to the background investigation and clearance check, which may take anywhere from one week to one month,I wanted to keep you informed ahead of time.

Reflecting on my 3,321 days at Mi Lab, I am deeply grateful for all the experiences and opportunities I’ve had working alongside both of you. Dr. Mi, I still remember our first conversation when you encouraged me to see myself as a blank page, ready to draw my own path. Your guidance, along with Dr. Zhou’s mentorship, has been instrumental in shaping my career and personal development. I truly value everything I’ve learned during my time here.

With my growing family, I feel both excited and exhausted. I’ve come to realize that I need to embrace a new phase in my career—one where I can connect with others in different settings and continue to grow. This was not an easy decision, as Mi Lab has truly felt like a second home.

I had hoped to share this news with you over the phone, but I felt it might be too difficult. I trust you understand my decision, and I want to assure you that I will do everything I can to ensure a smooth transition.

Thank you again for your incredible mentorship and the opportunities you have provided me. I will always remember my time at Mi Lab.

Best,
Jie
